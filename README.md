# xMEFiSTo

Tooling related to the Situational Method Engineering Framework xMEFiSTo for test case migration which was extended from the [Situational Method Engineering Framework xMEFiSTo](https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:466:2-24824) for system migration.

The tooling mainly consists of two parts:

## 1. metamodel
The metamodel definitions that are necessary to create xMEFiSTo models are modelled using [EMF and Ecore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Modeling_Framework).

## 2. view
The view folder contains the modeling workbench definitions which act as an editor to create and manipulate the xMEFiSTo models. These are defined using [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/).
